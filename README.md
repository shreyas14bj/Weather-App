# Weather-App
A simple weather condition app built using JavaScript and HTML/CSS, where users input a temperature value, and the app displays the corresponding weather condition (e.g., Cold, Moderate, or Hot) using conditional logic. This project helped me understand control flow, if-else statements, and user input handling in JavaScript.
